# HTML-Hyper Text Markup Language 

### 1) Why it is called Hyper Text Markup Language 

Hyper text mean text which contains Link 

Markup defines the structure of the content which we can achieve by diffrent HTML tags
Like paragraph tag heading tag etc

Language set of rules

### 2) What is Metatag
Meta data means data about data 

size of data, owner of data etc

In HTML we have meta tags that define some of things

On a lighter note we can say Head tag act as an meta tag for HTML document 

```
<head >
It contains meta tags
<link rel="stylesheet"  href="">
</head>
```

```
What type of character it support 
<meta charset="UT-16">

<meta name="keyword"  content="" >

screen size
<meta name ="viewpoint"  content>

<meta name =description >

```
```

<base href =""  target="">

it act as an base url for every other url in the document HTML

```

### 3) Sementic tags and non sementic tags
```
Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. On the other hand, tags like <div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements
```

### 4) Code 
```

<code >to write some code like console.log</code>
<kbd>to write linus code </kbd>

```

### 5) Form tag 
```
<form  action=""  post="">  

</form>

Diffrence between post and get 
post send the form data in encryted way but get donot

```
